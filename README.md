# DSA210 Project
Discord Sentiment Analysis

## Motivation
For this project I've wanted to use a source of which I could get the most data about myself. And well, in this day and age it ought to be social media, doesn't it? Except the only social media-like app I use frequently ~~is~~ used to be Discord (up until the day it was banned in our country, of course, since I'm a good citizen :) ). Luckily, my Discord data is easily accessible to me, and the diverse nature of text data is perfectly fit for an EDA project! Moreover, by analying the contents of my messages I could gain insights on my own online behavior.

## Dataset
The data was directly obtained through a request to Discord, and includes all messages I've ever sent, with the following properties:
- Content: This is the raw text I sent
- Timestamp: Date and time of sending the message
- Attachments: Images or other media I might have included in the message
- ID: Unique message ID for each message I've sent
- Type: Either "Guild" or "DM"
  - If Guild:
    - Guild Name: Name of the server the message was sent in
    - Guild ID: Unique ID of the server the message was sent in
  - If DM:
    - Recipients: Unique user ID's of the recipients
