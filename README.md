# dsa210-project
DSA210 Fall 2024 Term Project

## Dataset
For this project I've decided to use my Discord messages as the dataset. I've contemplated using other datasets, which there aren't many since I don't use most social media, nor have a spotify account. My chess games on chess.com could've been another option, however I haven't been playing for that long, so the dataset would be rather small which could become a major limitation. I believe my Discord data, a platform which I've consistently been using for a long time (up until the day it was banned in our country, of course, since I'm a good citizen :) ) with no major pauses or irregularities, would be a good pick as a large and representative dataset.

## Project Idea and Plan
The dataset, comprising of text messages and their respective timestamps, is very rich in information, and could be used in many ways. For this project, a simple yet interesting analysis could be in counting and plotting the number of messages in specific intervals of time, i.e. daily, weekly, or monthly. Or based on specific weekdays etc. etc. My null hypothesis would be that there's no significant difference overall.

Something more interesting however, which I'm not sure if it would fall under the scope of this course, thus I'll need to consult with this course's advisors first, would be performing a sentiment analysis over time. This I could then try to relate with bigger events in real life, both global issues, such as major elections, and personal ones, such as the death of loved ones, or the last 2 semesters, in which I had decided to quit university for personal reasons, and as such was on leave for a year. I'd be curious to see how such events reflect on my online behavior. My null hypothis would be the believe I personally hold, which is that there's no significant relation between my online behavior and real life events, as I try not to show any of it.

This concludes the project proposal, I wish you a great day :)
